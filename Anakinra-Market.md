Market Restraints

High Treatment Costs: Despite the growing popularity of Anakinra, the high cost of treatment remains a significant restraint in many regions. For some patients, the financial burden of biologic drugs may prevent them from opting for this treatment.
Adverse Effects and Safety Concerns: Though Anakinra is generally well-tolerated, it may cause side effects such as injection site reactions or increased susceptibility to infections. These safety concerns can hinder the widespread adoption of Anakinra, especially in patients with underlying health conditions.
Limited Awareness in Developing Markets: In several developing markets, the lack of awareness regarding the efficacy of Anakinra and the scarcity of healthcare infrastructure to administer these therapies is a challenge. This limits market penetration in regions with high demand for advanced biologic treatments.
